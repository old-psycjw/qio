# qio

An updated version of the QIO Haskell Monad, written by Dr. Alexander S Green, and Prof. Thorsten Altenkirch, found at https://github.com/alexandersgreen/qio-haskell and http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QIO. 

This project is being created for my Dissertation, and has aims to implement the following:
- Update current QIO project
- Implement Grover's Algorithm
- Look at improving the current implementation of Shor's Algorithm
- Implement a Quantum Circuit Builder/Interpreter

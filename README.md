# qio

An updated version of the QIO Haskell Monad, written by Dr. Alexander S Green, and Dr. Thorsten Altenkirch, found at https://github.com/alexandersgreen/qio-haskell. 

This project is being created for my Dissertation, and has aims to implement the following:
- Update current QIO project
- Implement Grover's Algorithm
- Implement HHL's Linear Algorithm
- Re-implement Shor's Algorithm
- Potentially implement a Quantum Circuit Builder/Interpreter
- Potentially look into possible Quantum Error Correction methods
